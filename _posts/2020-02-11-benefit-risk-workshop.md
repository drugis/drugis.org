The ADDIS team supported a three-day workshop, organised in Ljubljana by and for clinical assessors. The focus of the workshop was on building useful effect tables and quantifying and discussing preferences. ADDIS MCDA was used to demonstrate how preference elicitation and Multicriteria Decision Analysis can support the regulatory decision making process.
