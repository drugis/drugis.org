We are proud to announce the addition of a tool to the ADDIS suite: the ADDIS MCDA Survey Tool. It is now possible in the enterprise version of ADDIS MCDA to create and configure surveys for problems. Configuration choices include the partial value functions, the preference elicitation method and the texts shown to the surveyees. Once published, a link is created which can be sent to surveyees. Their responses are then made available for SMA analysis in ADDIS MCDA. For access to a testing version of ADDIS MCDA Enterprise, please [/contact](contact) us.
