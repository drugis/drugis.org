Daan was invited to present a talk at the technical forum of [https://www.nice.org.uk/](NICE) to demonstrate the ADDIS software suite. Originally planned to be held in-person, it was postponed and held virtually due to COVID-19. The talk was titled 'Efficient and transparent decision support using ADDIS software' and covered all aspects of integrated ADDIS, from clinical trials data management to benefit-risk analysis. The talk was well-received.
