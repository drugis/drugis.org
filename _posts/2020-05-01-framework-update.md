As has been known for some time, Google is [ending support for its AngularJS framework](https://blog.angular.io/stable-angularjs-and-long-term-support-7e077635ee9c), in which the user interfaces of our applications are built. The team took some time and re-implemented test slices of old parts of the application to test several alternative frameworks (React, Angular, VueJS, Elm), and ended up choosing [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the preferred option to replace AngularJS. Leading concerns were likelihood of the framework being supported in the future, large plugin and developer community and the comparative simplicity and clarity of its data flow model. A copy of our analysis of the frameworks is available upon request.
