Aggregate Data Drug Information System (ADDIS) Desktop is a proof-of-concept system that allowed us to simultaneously discover the possibilities of and the requirements on a database of structured clinical trials data.
We support the automated discovery and (meta-)analysis of trial data, as well as benefit-risk assessment.

### Current status

The latest version of ADDIS Desktop is [ADDIS 1.16.8](/software/addis-desktop/addis1.16), released on 2016-11-14.

From April 2009 until October 2012, we released a new major version of ADDIS approximately every 3 months.
The last major release of ADDIS Desktop was [ADDIS 1.16](/software/addis-desktop/addis1.16), released on 2012-10-04.
From October 2012, ADDIS development is in 'maintenance mode', meaning that no new major releases are planned.
Releases will be made as needed, primarily to fix bugs.

Work is now proceeding on the [ADDIS](/software/addis) web-based system for health care policy decision support.
See the [ADDIS Desktop retrospective](/software/addis-desktop/retrospective) for a technical evaluation of ADDIS Desktop and motivations for the development of a new system.
