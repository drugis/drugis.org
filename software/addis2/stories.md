title: ADDIS 2 user stories
---

<div id="toc"></div>

This document tracks user stories for the ADDIS 2 project and collects them into themes.

Development of ADDIS 2 is an iterative process.
Within this iterative process, we distinguish two layers of iteration:

 - The release: lasts a quarter year. Aims for a complete set of functionality, delivered to end users.
 - The iteration: lasts two weeks. User stories are selected for implementation at the start of the iteration. They are selected based on customer priorities and developer estimates of implementation complexity.

User stories describe coherent and self-contained pieces of user-visible functionality. 
Within this definition, we aim for user stories to be as small as possible in terms of implementation complexity, so that we can plan for multiple stories to be implemented each (two-week) iteration.
Moreover, user stories should ideally be as independent of each other as is reasonable, so that they can be implemented in any order based on prioritization.
User stories should have a clear description of their functional requirements and where appropriate should also define their user interface and application programming interface (API) requirements, as well as the assumptions that were made when writing the user story.
Finally, when user stories are considered for implementation in the next release, the developers estimate their complexity in abstract units called "story points".
Over the course of development, the team learns about their "velocity": the number of story points that can be implemented per iteration.
This allows a forecast of the number of story points that can be implemented in a release, and thus formulating a (tentative) release roadmap.

Themes are a higher level description of a set of related functionalities that together allow users to complete a specific task or collection of related tasks to their satisfaction. 
Although a theme may start out as just a description, it will need to be broken down into specific user stories before it can be implemented.
This should be done before the theme enters the planning horizon (i.e. when we expect to start working on the theme in the current or next release).
Note that specifying the stories too early may incur rework costs down the road as the system and the user expectations start to take shape.
Partitioning a theme into user stories can often be done in multiple ways, where the intuitive way might actually result in high implementation complexity.
Therefore, defining the user stories is an iterative process between developers and the other stakeholders.

This document is formatted in plain text using the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax.
This allows us to automatically publish this document on our website and track versions on GitHub.
Please follow these guidelines when contributing to themes and stories:

- One sentence per line (no more, no less). This allows us to view changes on a sentence-by-sentence basis.
- Separate paragraphs by a (single) empty line.
- Number themes and stories in order of creation.
  If you are unsure what the number should be, leaving it out is better than guessing.
- Preview your changes in rendered HTML before committing them.

## Theme 1: analysis projects

Source: UMCG / re-implementation of ADDIS 1.x features

Purpose:

Typically, any project (systematic review, decision analysis, etc.) will include several related analyses, capturing them under a single umbrella.
To frame the analyses that he/she is planning to do, a user must define the "universe of discourse" - this includes the clinical trials under consideration and the relevant outcomes and interventions being studied.
This relates directly to PICO: population (accounted for in trial selection), interventions / control, outcomes.

Assumptions:

 - The set of trials that are relevant for the analysis has already been constructed (i.e. the systematic review step has been done).
    * This assumption can be met because we have prototyped the "TrialVerse" database and an importer for ADDIS 1 files.
      We will fill the database with several imports of ADDIS 1 files and allow the user to choose between them.
      This can work as a stop-gap until data entry in ADDIS 2 is possible.
 - Harmonized entities (outcomes, drugs, etc.) are already available for the set of trials under consideration.
   Simply choosing from this set of harmonized entities is useful (though not necessarily "complete").
    * Our prototype implementation of ConceptMapper has resulted in a data model for TrialVerse that allows us to ignore the harmonization issue initially, yet be confident that we can address it later on.

### Story 1: [DONE] basic user login / account management

Source: UMCG

Tagline: As a user, I want to be able to securely log in to my personal account so that (1) my work is properly attributed to me and (2) others are prevented from modifying my work without permission.
Ideally, I do not want to create a new set of credentials to remember, I would rather log in using an account I already have.

Implementation checklist:

 - The application should only be available to logged in users
 - Users that are not logged in should be redirected to the log in screen
 - The log in screen provides some basic information about the application and how user credentials are stored
 - Logging in is done via a third party (OAuth provider)
    * Note: initially this will be Google, to be replaced by ORCID as their authentication API becomes available
 - Users are able to log out
 - Users are routed to HTTPS to ensure their requests are secure / confidential
 - Username / password authentication is available 

User interface:

 - Can be taken from https://mcda.drugis.org/

API requirements: none.

## Theme 2: Single study benefit-risk analysis (SSBR)

Source: UMCG / re-implementation of ADDIS 1.x features

Purpose:

Policy makers may want to assess the implications of a single large trial for the benefit-risk balance of a number of alternative interventions.
Using a single study minimizes the number of intervening analyses that need to be done, as the performance distributions for each of the interventions (alternatives) and outcomes (criteria) can be estimated directly from the trial's results.

Assumptions:

 - Outcomes and interventions have been defined by the user

 - The trial data is available from TrialVerse, and can be mapped to the defined outcomes and interventions

 - The actual MCDA functionality is available as a separate component (web-based UI and computational backend)

    * This is already up & running at https://mcda.drugis.org/

## Theme 3: Network meta-analysis

Source: UMCG / re-implementation of ADDIS 1.x features

Purpose:

Decisions regarding alternative treatment options should ideally take into account all available evidence.

Assumptions:

 - Outcomes and interventions have been defined by the user

 - The trial data is available from TrialVerse, and can be mapped to the defined outcomes and interventions

 - The actual NMA functionality is available as a separate component (web-based UI and computational backend)

    * See the "GeMTC web interface" story

## Theme 4: GeMTC web interface

Source: UMCG / re-implementation of ADDIS 1.x features

Purpose:

Network meta-analysis is an important statistical method that is increasingly being used for evidence synthesis in systematic reviews.
A user-friendly interface for network meta-analysis is therefore valuable independent of the ADDIS project proper, so it makes sense to provide it as an independent component.

Assumptions:

 - The computational functionality has been implemented in R, in such a way that it can be exposed as a Patavi web service. The data format is sufficiently well-defined that a JSON model can be specified.

### Story 19: select primary model

Source: UMCG / re-implementation of ADDIS 1.x features

Tagline: As an analyst / decision maker, I want to mark (at most) one of the models I've created as primary, to indicate my judgment as to what is the most appropriate model, and to be able to use its results in further analyses.

Implementation checklist:

- The user can select one of the (consistency) models as the primary model (IFF owner)

User interface: TODO.

### Story 20: cache model results

Source: UMCG / re-implementation of ADDIS 1.x features

Tagline: As a user, I want the results of previously estimated models to be cached, so that they are immediately available.

Implementation checklist:

- Cache results server-side and make them available though a REST repository

### Story 21: customize priors

Source: UMCG / re-implementation of ADDIS 1.x features

Tagline: As an analyst, I want to customize the prior distributions used by GeMTC so that I can ensure they correspond to my prior beliefs and/or I can ensure that they are consistent between analyses and/or I can study their impact on the results.

Implementation checklist:

- A reasonable range of different priors can be selected
  * Assumes these have already been implemented in GeMTC R package; see [GeMTC issue #16](https://github.com/gertvv/gemtc/issues/16)

## Theme 5: meta-analysis based benefit-risk analysis (MABR)

Source: UMCG / re-implementation of ADDIS 1.x features

Purpose:

Policy makers want to assess the benefit-risk balance of a number of alternative interventions, for example to decide whether or not a new medicine should be allowed on the market, or to provide recommendations on the first-line therapy for a specific condition.
Such decisions should take into account all available evidence, which typically requires a network meta-analysis.
Thus network meta-analysis should inform the MCDA model.

Assumptions:

 - Outcomes and interventions have been defined by the user

 - The results of network meta-analyses assessing the effect of the relevant interventions on each of the relevant outcomes are available

 - The actual MCDA functionality is available as a separate component (web-based UI and computational backend)

    * This is already up & running at https://mcda.drugis.org/

## Theme 6: patient-level disease progression modeling

Source: GetReal DoW D4.4

Purpose:

To predict RE and absolute benefits and harms in patients and populations that differ in terms of risk factors and co-morbidities, adherence or uptake of therapy.
This may include the simulation of rare or less common diseases, drug with companion diagnostic, tumours with genetic marker, and primary antineoplastic targeted agents.

The model will be driven by transition times from one state to the next, which are described by transition-specific hazard functions.
An individual-level simulation model based on discrete health states is envisaged, but different model structures or designs that may be appropriate for specific case study disease areas will be tested.
For each state hazard functions and its parameters are specified and transition times simulated from a piecewise constant approximation of the hazard function.
Transitions between states depend on baseline characteristics and on the history of previous events. 

It should be possible to take certain parameters from the results of network meta-analyses.

Assumptions:

 - A generic framework / simulation model has been developed by UoB (T4.4.2) and is sufficiently general that it can be implemented in ADDIS.

 - A reference implementation in R is delivered by UoB (T4.4.3) and has been tested for suitability in case studies (T4.4.4). Thus the primary task is to develop a user interface around that existing functionality.

 - Suitable network meta-analysis models have been implemented, which result in estimates compatible with the disease state models. This should be known ahead of time (T4.4.1). Also see [Theme 7](#Theme-7).

## Theme 7: network meta-analysis with competing risk survival

Source: GetReal DoW D4.4

Purpose:

Simulations are likely to be driven by risk equations that represent disease progression and how this is altered by different therapies.
The model will be driven by transition times from one state to the next, which are described by transition-specific hazard functions.
Such transitions are mutually exclusive outcomes, which corresponds to competing risks between multiple outcomes in the clinical trials.
Thus, the parameters of these models will be informed by network meta-analyses of competing risk outcomes.

Assumptions:

 - Competing risks meta-analysis is indeed deemed necessary (T4.4.1) for the proper parameterization of the disease progression models ([Theme 6](#Theme-6)).

 - A reference implementation in R is delivered by UoB (T4.4.3) and has been tested for suitability in case studies (T4.4.4). Thus the primary task is to develop a user interface around that existing functionality.

## Theme 12: Basic post-hoc harmonization of concepts

Source: GetReal DoW D4.13

Purpose:

Often data on different trials will be entered by various parties for varying reasons.
Therefore, it may not a priori be obvious that they measure the same or similar concepts, and it may be necessary to "harmonize" the concepts before the trials can be jointly analyzed.
To this end, users should be able to indicate when two outcomes or interventions are instances of the same higher-level concept.
This should support existing terminologies such as SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, and ATC.
